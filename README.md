# DeepEarth: Planetary Simulator for Ecological Intelligence 

DeepEarth is a new AI foundation model that fuses multimodal data and spatiotemporal simulation for scientific modeling of physical systems across the planet.  Similar to how ChatGPT was trained to reconstruct masked language datasets, DeepEarth learns to reconstruct masked earth science datasets, including from fields of physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and ecology.

## Exciting News:

- _September 30, 2025_  
  **Presentation at top AI lab.** 
  DeepEarth was presented at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org) in a 1 hour talk with scientists pioneering [AI foundation models for the planet](https://allenai.org/earth-system). See [_YouTube presentation_](  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHJwCInICiA).

- _September 25, 2025_  
  **Breakthrough spacetime encoding!** [Earth4D](https://github.com/legel/deepearth/tree/main/encoders/xyzt) is now ready for modeling of high entropy geospatial and temporal distributions with state-of-the-art precision. See code for [_AlphaEarth_](https://github.com/legel/deepearth/blob/main/encoders/xyzt/earth4d_to_lfmc.py) and [_fire ecology_](https://github.com/legel/deepearth/blob/main/encoders/xyzt/earth4d_to_lfmc.py).

- _August 8, 2025_  
  **Teamed up to save the world.** NSF funded a week-long DeepEarth R&D program on ["Spatial AI for Disaster Resilience"](https://i-guide.io/summer-school/summer-school-2025/) in Colorado. 5 PhD students simulated fire ecology and continue to collaborate.  See [_demos_](https://github.com/legel/deepearth/blob/main/docs/DeepEarthüî•_NSF_I-GUIDE_Final_Presentation.pdf).

- _June 23, 2025_  
  **Joining forces with GeoAI leaders.** NSF funded a 3 hour workshop on DeepEarth in Chicago for a ["GeoAI for Sustainability"](https://i-guide.io/forum/forum-2025/workshops/) conference. 3 professors, 5 postdocs, and 2 PhD students contributed.  See [_slides_](https://github.com/legel/deepearth/blob/main/docs/NSF_DeepEarth_Workshop.pdf).

#### Deep Physical Simulation  
DeepEarth is designed to deliver state-of-the-art modeling representations that can directly answer classical Bayesian questions, _e.g._ "As variable X changes across space S and time T, how is variable Y most likely to change, given all available evidence?"

#### Encoding the Planet
 DeepEarth is designed to discover the most predictive neural network parameters for multimodal observations across space and time.  It learns across (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_, _energy_) metrics, where _energy_ can be any set of real-valued metrics ‚Ñù<sup><em>d</em></sup>.  

#### Convergent Scientific Modeling 
Input any number of datasets distributed across space and time (_e.g._  satellite imagery, geological surveys, biodiversity records) and then automatically learn deep inductive priors across modalities.  

#### Deep Spacetime Manifold
One of the great lessons from Einstein's _relativity_ is that _space_ and _time_ are not independent variables.  DeepEarth learns unified (x,y,z,t) deep vector representations as ["multi-resolution hash encodings"](https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs348n-22-winter/LectureSlides/FinalSlides/ING.pdf).  This unlocks deep learning of the most complex physics.

#### Top of the Class
Design and development of DeepEarth is led by award-winning scientists and engineers from Stanford University, University of Florida, and Ecodash.ai, along with one of the first engineers from Google DeepMind.  

#### Planetary Intelligence for Everyone
DeepEarth is an MIT-licensed open source project designed and built to solve planetary-scale problems üåé, especially through AI-powered maximization of ecosystem services ‚Äì _e.g._ for sustainable agriculture, environmental restoration, & ecological landscape design.
